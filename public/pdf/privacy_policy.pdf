This privacy policy does not require any physical, electronic or digital signature.
This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how bandhaluanubhandalu.com (“bandhaluanubhandalu.com” or “we”) collects, transmits, and stores information about our Users. This Privacy Policy is not a contract and does not create any legal rights. Providing your information is voluntary and your use of the Service (defined below) constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.

Collection of Information
Information provided by you
This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect via the App bandhaluanubhandalu (“App”), email, telephone, electronic devices and other interactive services. In order to help you get the most out of our service, we collect User submitted personally identifiable information (“PII”) when you use the Service. For example we may collect information you provide when you create an account, create or edit your profile, upload content (photographs, essays, lessons, etc.), provide profile descriptions or comments, participate in a contest or promotion, participate in interactive features of the Service, connect or communicate with us via third party social media sites, send us an email, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us or communicate with others users through the Service. Such information may include your name, address, password, email address, and phone number for communication purposes. Information may be submitted to the App or via telephone or email when communicating with a bandhaluanubhandalu.com representative. For students and parents, we may collect information related to your payment for tutoring sessions and content you upload for the purposes of transmitting it to another user or for public display on the App. For tutors, we may collect your country specific identification number (SSN, Aadhar etc.) and date of birth, for tax purposes or to complete a background check; we also collect content you upload for purposes related to transmission to other users or public display on the App. As detailed in the “Data Transmission and Storage” section below, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption on any page of the App where we ask you to submit personally identifiable information and encrypt all such information for safe storage in our system.
Information we collect automatically
We also gather non-PII when you use the Service, including type of browser you use, access time, pages viewed, your IP address; and we collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access the Service, including without limitation operating system and unique device identifiers and mobile network information. This data is used to better understand and enhance the user experience on the Apps. bandhaluanubhandalu.com may publish these statistics or share them with third parties without including PII. Some browsers allow you to indicate that you would not like your online activities tracked, using “Do Not Track” indicators (“DNT Indicators”), however we are not obligated to respond to these indicators. Presently we are not set up to respond to DNT Indicators. This means that we may use latent information about your online activities to improve your use of our Service, but such usage is consistent with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
Information we collect from other sources
We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Service. For example, we may collect information about you from other users, identity verification services, credit bureaus, mailing list providers and publicly available sources.

Data transmission, storage and security
bandhaluanubhandalu.com uses industry best practices to keep any information collected and/or transmitted to the bandhaluanubhandalu.com network or Third-Party Apps secure. This includes the use of HTTP with TLS (Transport Layer Security), which encrypts all transmitted data.
We use 64-bit SSL encryption when collecting and transmitting your information through the App and the bandhaluanubhandalu.com network (collectively, the “System.”). Once information has been collected, we encrypt sensitive data (i.e., PII) in our database for added security. bandhaluanubhandalu.com also uses firewalls and hardware monitoring across our System to protect against unauthorized access. Unfortunately, even with these measures, bandhaluanubhandalu.com cannot guarantee the security of PII. By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that bandhaluanubhandalu.com makes no such guarantee, and that you use the Service at your own risk.
In addition, bandhaluanubhandalu.com uses third-party vendors and hosting partners such as Amazon to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services. These vendors have been selected for their high standards of both physical and technological security, including ISO and SSAE16 certifications.
